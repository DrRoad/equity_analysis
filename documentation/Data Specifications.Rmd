Context

    Software for 'data science' is evolving
    In R, packages ggplot2 and dplyr have become immensely popular and now they are a part of the tidyverse
    These packages use the 'tidy data' principles for consistency and speed of processing (from vignette("tidy-data")):

        Each variable forms a column.
        Each observation forms a row.
        Each type of observational unit forms a table

    Historically spatial R packages have not been compatible with the tidyverse
